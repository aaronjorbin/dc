BeerJS DC
=========

BeerJS DC is a welcoming get-together for everyone who wants to learn about JavaScript. 
We meet the second Tuesday of the month at [Matchbox Chinatown](http://www.yelp.com/biz/matchbox-chinatown-washington). 
That's all the planning we have: whoever shows up decides what happens.

Why BeerJS DC?
--------------

- We welcome JavaScripters of all experience levels, including complete beginners, who seek to learn and meet new friends. 

- We do no more planning than needed: come with your own questions or ready to answer others’. 

- We are not interested in sponsors, recruiters, or pitches. Leave your company affiliation at the door and come learn with us. To make this a reality, we consciously eliminate any financial dependence or any use the group might have for outsiders. That’s why we meet in free, public places, don't have speakers or planned events, and don't have any online communication.
